# Care for Campus AI – MVP Context

## 🎯 Vision
Care for Campus AI is an intelligent infrastructure maintenance platform designed to monitor, manage, and optimize campus facilities through AI-powered prioritization, predictive maintenance, and real-time tracking.

Instead of just reacting to issues, the system identifies risk patterns and improves resolution efficiency across the campus.
